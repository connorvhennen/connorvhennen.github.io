<p>(8) CHARACTER â€” Connor Hennen will be remembered for his skill and leadership in a long and distinguished varsity soccer career at El Molino. Along the way, he was among the team leaders in scoring and assists, finishing as one of the best in the SCL. He also used his strong leg on the varsity football team as a kickoff and field goal specialist. (Photo by Greg Clementi)</p></br>


<h2> Part 2: News article where I'm featured for sticking up for a great professor during a very rough and unfair time for her.</h2>

<font style="font-size: 1.2em">Melissa Platero, who shared the professor's email on Facebook, wrote: 'F*** all the professors who are asking for students to finish their finals and assignments, regardless of whether or not they have cancelled class.</font>

<font style="font-size:1.2em">A friend of Platero chimed in adding that the request was 'absolutely disgusting.'I hope they get fired,'&nbsp;Kelly Bourque added.</font>

<font style="font-size:1.2em">But others leaped to the defense of the popular professor.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1em">Connor Hennen wrote that Lew's email may have appeared 'callous', 'but I feel obligated to say that they are actually one of the most understanding and generous professors I've encountered at UCLA.'</font></p> 

<p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">He added that it was unlikely Lew was aware of the active shooter situation when she wrote the communication.</font></p> 

<font style="font-size:1.2em">'As a professor she probably wasn't exposed to all the outlandish speculation that was floating around the student body and didn't realize how traumatized or scared many people might have felt.'</span></p>
