								<h2>New York Menus</h2>
								<p><u>Objective:</u> Given a dataset of approximately 70,000 menus, our team was tasked with “telling the story buried in the data” by the UCLA Digital Humanities Program. The menus were from across the United States, and ranged from the early 20th century to 21st century. We were set to present our findings in December of 2015, 10 weeks after being provided the dataset.  </p>
  								<p><u>Final Product:</u> We produced a digital exhibit, outlining the story of how 20th century immigration patterns into Staten Island, New York, were reflected in the origins menu dishes of high end hotels of New York just a generation later. This led us to the conclusion that an influx of a cultural groups into the United States would quickly fuse United States and immigrating cultures together, eventually influencing the palates of the upper class. My role was that of the Data Analyst/Visualization Specialist, and I worked in Open Refine, TimelineJS, and Tableau to create data-driven visualizations. The project was later cited by Professor Lisa Flanders in her paper “The Shape of Data in Digital Humanities.”</p>

								<h2>Digital Karnak</h2>
								<p><u>Objective:</u> To explore the role of Virtual Reality on learning, with emphasis on visual learners. This project was taken on specifically by the <a href = 'https://idre.ucla.edu/'> IDRE </a> to establish a pipeline for converting 3d models produced by the lab GIS and Modelling teams. This was a solo project, and I was provided access to UCLA’s Digital Karnak project files and used an Occulus Rift to test my environment.</p>
  								<p><u>Final Product:</u> Using a combination of C# scripts and the Unity software, I built a virtual reality version of <a href = http://dlib.etc.ucla.edu/projects/Karnak/> Digital Karnak </a> that contained ten facts about the site that players could interact with. I then compared fact retention rates in VR to those reading facts in plain text. While the difference between retention rates was not statistically significant, the presence of lurking variables such as VR dizziness or VR novelty may have a played a major impact. The findings were submitted as a Digital Humanities Capstone project, and was presented at the Annual Digital Humanities conference. </p>

								<h2>Texture Prediction</h2>
								<p><u>Objective:</u> Given a dataset of EEG readouts (32 nodes, 500Hz sampling) collected from 4,000 grasp-and-lift trials, determine the material the subject is grasping. The subject was unaware of the material type until they touched the weights, meaning that material identity would be best determined by EEG signals dependent on tactile information. The project was conducted in hopes of applying our findings towards brain-computer interfaces for prosthetics.</p>
								<p><u>Final Product:</u> By simplifying the problem down to coarse and non-coarse materials, we were able generate a reliable binary classifier using a Feed Forward Neural Network. What was also interesting was during our feature selection, 14 of the 25 top indicators of surface material and grip force were related to the F3 and F8 nodes (in red), and 10 of the best indicators were related to harmonic mean across the entire brain. These findings were presented to the UCLA Maoz Decision Lab. </p>

								<h2>Seizure Prediction</h2>
								<p><u>Objective:</u> Given a dataset of clinical EEG readouts (23 nodes, 64Hz sampling) collected from 11 patients with seizures, build a predictive model that not only can identify seizures but also predict the onset of an upcoming seizure.</p>
								<p><u>Final Product:</u> Our team built a variety of preprocessing strategies and machine learning models fit to the data. Most models were very successful at identifying seizures, as brain readouts during a seizure are quite distinct across most EEG nodes. We therefore explored the relation between models that are strong at identifying seizures and those that are strong at prediction. The models of interest included Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors, Feed-Forward Neural Network, and SpecNet- an image classifier trained on the spectrogram readouts of the EEG nodes. A presentation on these models, their accuracies, and their limitations was given to the UCLA Brain Sciences community. </p>
