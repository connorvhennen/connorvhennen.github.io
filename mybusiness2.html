				<h3> Welcome!</h3>
				<p> My name is Connor Hennen, founder and CEO of Condor Flight Co. Our mission is to make your life more convenient and affordable. Specifically, we seek to get you your mail faster and cheaper using millions of deliverymen who are currently wasting their talents on long flights around the country and world! We coordinate with you, and an individual who is flying to your area with spare luggage room, to get you your product without anybody even having to make a special trip! <br/><br/> What inspired our business model? Shipping costs are out of control these days and there's no reason for it. We have hundreds of thousands of people moving all over the world at near sonic speed every single day. Surely, if people are already going from Point A to Point B, then they'll gladly accept modest compensation just to grab a package for you. Perhaps you need some medication or a new pair of shoes, but shipping across the country in 5-10 business days costs $10 and in 2 business days, $40. That's more than the product itself! Why not coordinate with someone who already has a flight booked to an airport half an hour away from you, that same night? Prices will range based on distance and package size but we guarantee it will be faster and cheaper than the courier delivery industry leaders.</p>
			<p> Think for a moment about the most exciting and successful companies within the service sector in the past decade. We have Uber, Lyft, Amazon, Postmates and Grubhub, to name a few. </p>
<h4> Why are they so successful?</h4> 
<ul>
  <li>They all make your life easier, more convenient, and in some cases, more affordable.</li>
  <li>They innovated in industries that are lagging.</li>
</ul> 
<p>Let's face it- the US courier system hasn't evolved for decades and we seek to be what Uber is to taxi drivers, but instead to UPS drivers.</p>
			<h4> Condor Flight Co. has grown in one of the most unique periods of innovation in modern history. We're in the middle of The Golden Age of Convenience and Affordability. </h4>
<p> I can go on about the merits of Condor, but first I need to make sure you're able to trust me, so allow me to tell you a bit about myself. I'm an undergraduate student at UCLA majoring in statistics with a very strong concentration in computer science, as well as a solid background in accounting and economics. As a statistics major, I'm well-versed in analyzing and scraping large amounts of data, and I've concluded that the vast majority of packages ordered each day can be delivered by the massive amounts of airplane passengers. Moreover, after gathering and analyzing countless surveys, polls, and the success of companies that pair two strangers together (Uber, Postmates), trust between fellow citizens (though strangers) is very high, and a very negligible amount of problems have come up. In other words, the US population is ready for this business model, on the consumer end, and the supply end. With an economics and accounting background, I understand these concepts well and can guarantee it is a win-win-win situation for all parties (except perhaps UPS and FedEx). With a computer science concentration, I love building things, appreciate the art, and take pride in my work. Our systems will be extremely efficient, reliable, and responsive to you.
